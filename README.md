# FileOrganizer
First Python Project to create a File Organizer
This Organize the files automatically based on their extensions.




Also one more update to do in this can be 
To display the No of Folders or Items in the organized folders on a GUI so we know what is clustering the Folder
Also be able to clear the whole Organizer Folder afterwards using one button.
